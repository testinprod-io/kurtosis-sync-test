# Ansible Component

Automated deployment and management of kurtosis-sync-test infrastructure on dedicated servers.

## Key Patterns
- Use ethpandaops.general roles for standard infrastructure components
- Deploy to /opt/kurtosis-sync-test/ with proper systemd service management
- Integrate with VictoriaMetrics for centralized monitoring via environment variables

## Critical Constraints
- Service runs as root for Docker/Kurtosis access
- Always preserve existing playbook structure and variable hierarchy
- Never commit SOPS encrypted files or expose credentials
