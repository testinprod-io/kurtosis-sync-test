# kurtosis_sync_test Role

Ansible role that deploys the kurtosis-sync-test oneliner.sh script as a managed systemd service.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Deploys from parent directory structure preserving network configurations
- Uses template-based environment variables for VictoriaMetrics authentication
- Follows standard Ansible role directory structure (tasks, handlers, templates)

## Important Constraints
- Must copy oneliner.sh and network configs from parent project directory
- Service configuration stored in /etc/kurtosis-sync/env with restricted permissions (0600)
- Requires pre-configured VictoriaMetrics credentials in group_vars
